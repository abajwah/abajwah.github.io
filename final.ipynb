    "### Introduction\n",
    "Every year in early February, no matter who or where you are in America, you will most likely hear about [the Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl). The Super Bowl is one of [the largest broadcasted events in the United States and in 2024 alone generated over 123.4 million viewers](https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/super-bowl-lviii-is-most-watched-telecast-in-history/#:~:text=Super%20Bowl%20LVIII%20is%20the%20most%2Dwatched%20program%20ever%2C%20averaging%20123.4%20million%20viewers%20across%20all%20platforms%2C%20up%20%2B7%25%20versus%20last%20year%27s%20Super%20Bowl%20which%20was%20the%20previous%20record%20(115.1%20million).), with over a billion dollars in revenue from ticket sales, advertisements, and broadcasting. Every year, hundreds of companies pay millions for [a 30-second advertisement](https://www.statista.com/topics/8999/super-bowl-advertising-in-the-us/#topicOverview:~:text=The%20result%3A%2030,in%20the%20text.) to play during ad breaks, making it one of the most expensive and lucrative advertising opportunities. That revenue does not include the billions of dollars in economic profit which also come from local businesses and betting. The Super Bowl is notably one of the largest and most profitable sports betting events in America. Every year, millions of Americans bet [billions of dollars altogether](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/record-68-million-people-plan-on-making-super-bowl-bets#:~:text=Bettors%20plan%20to%20wager%20an%20estimated%20%2423.1%20billion%20on%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20Super%20Bowl%2C%20up%20from%20%2416%20billion%20last%20year%2C%20the%20group%20predicted.) on matches throughout the season, but most importantly on the last match of the tournament. Apart from its obvious economic significance, the Super Bowl is also a display of American culture and is quite important socially. For millions of Americans, football is a hobby, a familial activity, and a career. The Super Bowl showcases this significance as it is often a time for families and friends to reconnect and make memories together. Given the economic and social significance of the Super Bowl, it is important to make informed decisions on betting, advertisement, or simply personally choosing which team to root for by using statistics of current and previous seasons' teams' winnings and losses. This is where data science is extremely useful. Using a collection of data, we can use the data science pipeline to analyze the history of bets, previous matches, and Super Bowls to provide useful information for future Super Bowls.\n",

Check out Kaggle [here!](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",

    "\n",
    "#####  `spread_favorite`\n",
    "In football betting, the term \"spread favorite\" refers to the team expected to win by a certain number of points as set by the betting odds. This team is typically considered stronger or in a better position to win the game, and the \"spread\" is the number of points by which bookmakers estimate the favorite is expected to outscore the underdog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Point Spread Bet:\n",
    "Suppose in an NFL game, the Green Bay Packers are playing against the Detroit Lions. If the Packers are listed as the \"spread favorite,\" the listing might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Green Bay Packers -7.5\n",
    "- Detroit Lions +7.5\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the Packers are favored to win by more than 7.5 points. For a bet on the Packers to pay out, they must win by 8 points or more. Conversely, a bet on the Lions would win if the Lions lose by 7 points or fewer, or if they win the game outright.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  `over_under_line`\n",
    "In football betting, the \"over/under\" line, also known as the total, is a wager on the combined score of both teams in a game. This betting line sets a predicted total score by the oddsmakers, and bettors can wager whether the actual combined score of the game will be over or under that set number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an Over/Under Bet:\n",
    "Suppose in an NFL game between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins, the over/under line is set at 47.5 points. Here are the betting options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over 47.5 Points: If you bet the over, you are predicting that the combined score of both teams will be 48 points or more.\n",
    "- Under 47.5 Points: If you bet the under, you are predicting that the combined score will be 47 points or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the final combined score is 48 points or more, the over bets win. If it is 47 points or fewer, the under bets win.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  `schedule_week`\n",
    "In this data set, the schedule week is usually a number. However, superbowl games are labeled as \"Superbowl\" in the `schedule_week` column."

    "As shown above, the spread bet winner is both the team that was favored to win and the actual winning team, or the spread bet winner is the actual winning team but was not the favorite. Since the proportion is >0.45, we can see that nearly half of the time, the spread bet winner is both the team that was favored to win and the team that actually won. This shows us that the spread bet predictions are reasonably accurate when the favorite team also wins the game. Our second bar also shows us that 38% of the time, the spread bet winner is the actual winner when the team wasn't favored to win before the game. This gives us important insights and shows us that while favorites are often good choices, there is a substantial number of instances where the underdog or non-favorite team wins the game. This also shows us that football, like many sports, is inherently unpredictable. Overall, this plot shows us a strong correlation between the spread bet outcome and the actual game outcome."

    "\n",
    "Our plot shows the average accuracy per fold. The overall average accuracy of our model across all folds is 0.7415, which suggests that our model on average correctly predicts the class of the samples approximately 74.15% of the time across all folds. \n",
    "Each fold represents a different parition of our data. Generally our model shows consistent accuracy across all folds suggesting that it generalizes across different subsets well. \n",
    "Finally this means that our model is running well on our training and validation data, meaning it can help us create an informed decision in the future."

    "### Interpretation: Insight\n",
    "Using the knowledge we've gained about the spread bet winner based on the winning and favorite teams, and the differences observed in over/under outcomes, while utilizing our predictive model based on win rate and average score differences, we can enhance betting strategies for future Super Bowls. For those interested in betting on the Super Bowl, as demonstrated in our tutorial, there is great potential for successful bets using predictors, particularly predicting who will win the Super Bowl. As shown by our accuracy per fold, our model is quite effective at predicting outcomes and can be even more useful in the future. By refining our data and further training our model on more features and more data, we can make even better bets in the long run. Although bettors should be mindful of the inherent unpredictable nature of football; as our exploratory data analysis has shown us, ultimately we cannot predict everything about a football game, thus our model and bets can be unsuccessful at times. However, generally our model and knowledge pprovides bettors with ample support to make more accurate bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "Since the Super Bowl is annual and consistently growing in viewership and social and economic impact, it is only natural to use machine learning tools to predict future outcomes of the Super Bowl in advance. Using two features, we have seen that average season win rate and average point difference can be useful in predicting which teams are likely to be within the top four at the end of the season. Additionally, as more games occur and more data is collected on different features, including specifics on player performance as it relates to a team's likelihood of ending up at the Super Bowl, we can further refine our model for even better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that for a more detailed and accurate analysis, it's best to involve more features and [datasets](https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats) on teams, players, and coaches. What we have is a rudimentary but fairly accurate model given the data we have, but there is always room for improvement."
